# Gnars Frontend Monorepo  

## Introduction

[Gnars DAO](https://gnars.wtf/) is a community-driven project inspired by Nouns DAO that brings together extreme sports, art, and decentralized governance.  
This frontend repository powers the web interface that allows users to interact with the Gnars ecosystem, including voting on proposals, viewing Gnars NFTs, and participating in DAO activities.
