## What is Gnars ? 

Gnars is a headless brand that empowers shredders with a shared treasury and tools for collective creation. We prefer a world where kids aren’t shilled energy drinks by their heroes. So we’ve formed a DAO to rethink how shredders get paid.

Based on Nouns open source code and CC0 artwork, each Gnar is an NFT stored fully onchain on Ethereum with no external dependencies (not even IPFS), and each one represents a DAO vote.
